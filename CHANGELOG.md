# Changelog

Notable changes to Jellyplex. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The version you are running is
shown in the account menu and on the login screen.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-11

First public version: Plex-style browsing, the video and music players, SyncPlay, playing on
other devices, the metadata editor and the server dashboard. See the
[README](README.md#features) for the full list.

### Added
- Prebuilt container images on GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io/charliegolfx/jellyplex`) for
  amd64 and arm64: `latest` and version tags for releases, `edge` for the main branch.
- The version is shown in the account menu and on the login screen.
- A page that runs into an error no longer blanks the whole app: the page shows a message with
  "Try again" and "Reload", and the sidebar, search and players keep working. The same goes for the
  video player, which is stopped without taking the page you are browsing with it. After an update,
  a page that belongs to the old version asks for a reload instead of failing.

### Development
- Unit tests (Vitest), browser tests (Playwright) and linting (oxlint), run by `npm run check`
  and `npm run test:e2e`, and on every push and pull request by GitHub Actions.
- The video player is split into smaller parts under `src/player/video/`.
